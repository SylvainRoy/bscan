# Todo:

 * Better user interface
   * command should not be an option
   * there should be a "do it all" command
 * check printing of pdf file generated


# Procedure:

 * Set up the table
   * Camera need to be "far". Better to seat on a small end.
   * Put heavy stuff on dark sheet to avoid it moving.
 * Set up the camera
   * Camera on tripod. As high as possible.
   * Ensure button is “on top”.
   * Ensure definition is S1.
   * Ensure it’s on remote command.
   * Set up zoom and auto focus. Then go to manual focus.
   * Get alignment stuff to ensure page in the area.


# Camera:

## On the Canon

The mode S1 is the minimum to use.
It gives picture of ~700KB before reframing. Probably less afterward.
So, 1000 pages => 700Mb. Big but OK.

No need to go S1+ (the one with a portion of circle next to it), it's bigger (1.3 MB) and not much better.

The maximum resolution gives images of 6MB.
Ok for doc of no more than 100 pages...
Then, the definition is clearly better and the writing does not suffer from pixelisation.

## On the iPhone

An image is roughly 2MB.
It's clearly better than the mode S1+... It would make an excellent scan.

Photos taken inside are not usable!
Only works with great luminosity.

## Conclusion:

Use the Canon.
Preferably Outside but flask does the job.
Definition: S1
